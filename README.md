# Detecting-Web-Attacks-Using-Machine-Learning
Our Web Attack Detection System addresses these gaps by leveraging an unsupervised machine learning model—an autoencoder neural network—to learn the statistical characteristics of normal HTTP/TCP traffic and flag deviations indicative of attacks. The model is trained solely on benign flows from the CICIDS2017
